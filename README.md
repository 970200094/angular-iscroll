# angular-iscroll
AngularJS module that enables iScroll 5 functionality, wrapping it in an easy-to-use directive

## Demo
You may have a look at an Angular [demo app](http://mtr.github.io/angular-iscroll/examples/) that shows how you can use the `iscroll` directive.  For example, the demo shows how to handle DOM content generated dynamically through [ngRepeat](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat).
